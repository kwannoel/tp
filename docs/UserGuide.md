TAsker is a **desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to manage student administration, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**. It still has the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAsker can get your administrative tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `TAsker.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TAsker.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   - **`list`** : Lists all student.

   - **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com t/johndoe m/A0123456B tg/friends` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   - **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

   - **`clear`** : Deletes all students.

   - **`exit`** : Exits the app.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  
- Any invalid parameter tags will be parsed as literals. 
  e.g., If we pass the `n/a/James` in as a parameter, 
  since `a/` is an invalid parameter tag,
  it will attempt to interpret `a/James` as a `NAME`,
  rather than treating `a/` as a parameter tag and `James` as its field.
  
- Extra inputs to commands will be ignored.
  e.g. `list 1`, `1` will be ignored, `exit abc`, `abc` will be ignored.

</div>

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [t/TELEGRAM] [m/MATRIC_NUMBER] [tg/TAG]…​`

- At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
- Existing values will be updated to the input values.
- When editing tags, the existing tags of the student will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
- You can remove all the student’s tags by typing `tg/` without
  specifying any tags after it.

Examples:

- `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st student to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
- `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower tg/` Edits the name of the 2nd students to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Locating students by name: `find`

Finds students whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

- The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
- Only the name is searched.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
- Students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

  we would get the following response if he was present:

  John was present on Sat Dec 12 00:00:00 SGT 2020
  ```
  
  If he was absent we would get this instead:

Format: `archive`

### Exporting attendance : `exportatt`

Exports attendance to a csv file in `data/attendance_YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm.csv`
